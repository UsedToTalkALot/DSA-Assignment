1)
When a user likes a post it will be saved and the like button turns to unlike 
which when clicked will decrease the like count and then turn back to like
but if it is reloaded then the post can be liked again making it possible for one user to be able to like same post multiple times

2)
tailored posts will be shown to a user as per their likings 
and this likings will be updated but
until and unless some new post does not reach to certain popularity
user will be seeing the same post
